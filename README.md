###BarkCity###
(Public clone of) Keystone project created for BarkCo. during my time at Flatiron School. 
Worked on between 11/24/14 - 12/09/14

New Yorkers are obsessed with their dogs, and rightly so! Unfortunately they are forced to leave their beloved friends at home
or with friends for many of their favorite bars, restaurants, and other locations. But what if you can plan the events of 
your day with your pup in mind? 

That was the goal of BarkCity: create a resource to rate and catalog dog-friendly locations in NYC using a granular rating
system that places locations on a scale raging from "not dog-friendly" to "dog-accomodating" to "dogs encouraged!"

The project leverages the Foursquare API for location data, along with a Parse backend to manage user-reviews and venue ratings.
Several cocoapods are in use, including [AFNetworking][AF], [Masonry][MS], [PKRevealController][PK], and [DateTools][DT].
